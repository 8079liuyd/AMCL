# Attention-Guided Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Predicting Sparse  Drug–Gene Associations

**Model is AMCL！**

To address the challenge of **data sparsity** in drug-gene interaction prediction, researchers propose a new deep learning model called **AMCL** (Attention-guided Multi-view Contrastive Learning).

AMCL integrates multi-scale feature learning by using a graph convolution network (GCN) for local information and a kernel function for global patterns. It also employs a dynamic hypergraph learning module to model high-order dependencies.
